## Overview

This project created a class, TestStatistics and a driver program, ProcessText to test the output of the class.
TestStatistics will take a text file and scan it. During the scan it will compile statistics on the file. It also 
implements methods based on TestStatisticsInterface. 

##Compiling and Using

This code can be compiled using the Konsole and the javac command or run from Eclipse
ProcessText does require at least one text file as command line input to run. It will output an error if there is not
at least one text file submitted.

##Testing
This code was compiled and tested throughout its formation.

After each section in the code was completed, it was tested to make sure each component printed out 
correctly and that the calculations were being coded correctly. 

The output of ProcessText was check using the provided text files to check that the methods were working as
intended. Also, TextStatisticsTest was used to check that the TestStatistics class was compiling the required
statistics correctly.
